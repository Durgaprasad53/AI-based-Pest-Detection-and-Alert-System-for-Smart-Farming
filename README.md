# AI-based Pest Detection and Alert System for Smart Farming

This project uses AI to detect pests in crops using real-time image input from cameras or drones. It helps farmers by:
- Providing early pest detection alerts
- Reducing pesticide usage
- Improving crop health and yield

## Features
- Real-time image capture
- YOLO-based pest detection
- Visual and email alerts
- Flask web interface

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Python, Flask
- OpenCV, YOLOv5

## How to Run
1. Run the `pest_frontend.py` file.

2. This will start the Flask web interface.
You'll see output like this in the terminal:
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   
3. Open your browser and go to:
 * http://127.0.0.1:5000/

4. Upload an image using the web interface.

5. The system will detect pests and display the results.
