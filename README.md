# AI-based Pest Detection and Alert System for Smart Farming

This project uses AI to detect pests in crops using real-time image input from cameras or drones. It helps farmers by:
- Providing early pest detection alerts
- Reducing pesticide usage
- Improving crop health and yield

## Features
- Real-time image capture
- YOLO-based pest detection
- Visual and email alerts
- Flask web interface

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Python, Flask
- OpenCV, YOLOv5

## How to Run
1)Make sure you have Python installed.

2)Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3)Run the following command to start the Flask app:
  >>python pest_frontend.py

4)Once the server starts, open your browser and go to:http://localhost:5000/

5)Upload an image through the web interface. The system will detect pests and display the results.

Note: This runs the app on your local machine.
